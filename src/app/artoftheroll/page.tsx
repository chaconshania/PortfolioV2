              <p>
                What happens when a group of ambitious college students from a
                regional campus decides to break a Guinness World Record? You
                get Art of the Roll, a project that turned into so much more
                than a dice mosaic. It became a story about dreaming bigger
                than anyone expected, rallying an entire community, and learning
                some expensive lessons along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the visual and web designer, I crafted the brand identity,
                built the website, and created Instagram content that helped us
                raise over $11,000 in just 60 days. But here&apos;s the thing:
                we&apos;re still figuring it out. This is a living, breathing
                project with plot twists and pivots that taught us more than any
                classroom ever could.

                  Creating the world&apos;s largest dice mosaic from a regional

                </h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                UConn Stamford is a regional campus. Translation? Fewer
                resources, smaller spotlight, and an uphill battle to get
                noticed. Our art club, Husky Art Pack, wanted to do something
                that would put us on the map and prove that big ideas
                don&apos;t just happen at main campuses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal was audacious: create the world&apos;s largest dice
                mosaic. The current record? 40,000 dice across 100 square feet.
                Our plan? Over 200,000 dice spanning 30 square meters.
                We&apos;d collaborate with Johnny Face Off from Design with
                Dice, a Stamford artist who specializes in dice art.

                  There was just one small problem: we needed $30,000. And we

                    We needed to make people care about dice. Like, really care.
                    The visual identity had to balance two competing ideas: the
                    precision and craft of the actual mosaic work, and the
                    scrappy, passionate energy of a student-led initiative.

                    The website became our digital headquarters. I built it to
                    showcase not just what we were making, but why it mattered.
                    Every page was designed to convert visitors into donors or
                    volunteers. We needed people to see themselves in this
                    story.

                    Instagram became our secret weapon. I designed posts that

                    The animated reels were crucial. Static images of dice?

                    the team&apos;s passion, hearing about the world record?
                    That&apos;s shareable content.

                  When ambition meets reality
                </h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Here&apos;s where it gets real. We recently had a major pivot
                with our artist collaborator, and we&apos;re rethinking the
                entire medium. Turns out, we were a little too ambitious. Okay,
                a lot too ambitious.
              </p>
              <p>
                Building a world record isn&apos;t just about having a cool idea
                and some dice. It&apos;s about budgets we drastically
                underestimated, logistics we didn&apos;t fully understand, and
                the reality check that comes with actually executing at this
                scale. We didn&apos;t realize how much money was going to go
                into trying to break a world record until we were already deep
                into it.

                  But here&apos;s the thing about design work: it&apos;s never
                  wasted. The brand we built, the community we rallied, and the
                  systems we created? Those aren&apos;t going anywhere.
                  They&apos;ll adapt with us.

              </div>

              <p>
                This project taught me that real design work isn&apos;t just
                about making things look good. It&apos;s about creating flexible
                systems that can weather changes, pivots, and even complete
                redirections. The Instagram content that helped us secure
                funding? That same strategy will help us communicate our new
                direction. The website I built? It&apos;s ready to evolve with
                our vision.

                    Building brand systems that can flex and adapt isn&apos;t
                    just good practice—it&apos;s essential. When your project
                    changes direction (and it will), your design infrastructure
                    should be able to keep up without starting from scratch.

                    The most successful content wasn&apos;t the most polished.
                    It was the most authentic. People connected with our story
                    because it was real, messy, and human. The Instagram posts
                    that performed best were the ones that showed our journey,
                    not just our destination.

                  <p>
                    We learned the hard way that world records cost money. Real
                    money. But that lesson? It&apos;s made us smarter, more
                    strategic, and better prepared for whatever comes next.

                    Being from a smaller campus became our superpower. It made
                    our story more compelling, our community tighter, and our
                    impact more meaningful. We weren&apos;t supposed to be able
                    to do this. That&apos;s exactly why people cared.

                We&apos;re regrouping, reimagining, and getting ready for round
                two. The project might look different than we originally
                planned, but the mission hasn&apos;t changed: prove that
                students from regional campuses can dream big and actually
                deliver.

                The brand identity, the community we built, and the momentum we
                created? That&apos;s all still here. We&apos;re just getting
                started.
