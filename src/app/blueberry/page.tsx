              </div>
              <p>
                It&apos;s 2 AM, and Maya, Head of Growth at ACME Skincare,
                wakes up to a notification. A defaming comment has been sitting
                at the top of their highest-performing Instagram ad for three
                hours. By morning, their ad engagement has dropped 30%, and
                potential customers are seeing negativity before they even learn
                about the product.
              </p>
              <p>
                This wasn&apos;t unique to Maya. Across mid-sized eCommerce
                brands pulling in $2M+ annually, social teams were drowning.
                They were manually scanning hundreds of comments daily, deciding
                what deserved responses, crafting replies that stayed on brand,
                and doing it all fast enough to protect conversion rates.

              </div>

              <p>
                E-commerce teams are expected to manage multiple social channels, respond to customer comments, and keep engagement high, all while running the rest of their business. This often means juggling dozens of messages at once and trying not to miss anything important. Keeping up can be exhausting, especially for businesses without a dedicated social media team. Missed comments can lead to lost sales, frustrated customers, or inconsistent brand messaging. This is why we designed Blueberry Social, a tool that brings every interaction into one clear inbox and surfaces the most important messages first. With AI assistance, teams can respond faster, maintain their brand voice, and turn everyday conversations into sales opportunities.

                  When everything changed halfway through
                </h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Halfway through the project, everything changed. We had spent
                weeks building a social listening tool for startup founders.
                Then the co-founders came back with new data: mid-sized
                eCommerce brands were the real opportunity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our entire ideal customer profile had flipped. Instead of solo
                entrepreneurs, we were now designing for growth teams at brands
                doing millions in revenue.
              </p>

              <div className="bg-[#f7fafc] border-l-4 border-[#667eea] p-6 rounded">
                <p className="font-medium italic">
                  We had a choice: panic and restart from scratch, or adapt
                  quickly and use what we&apos;d learned.
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                We made a deliberate decision to move fast. We used AI tools
                like V0 to spin up rapid prototypes, ran weekly testing
                sessions, and iterated based on real feedback. The goal
                wasn&apos;t perfection. It was reducing ambiguity fast enough to
                build something valuable.

                  My first instinct was to make onboarding feel natural with a
                  ChatGPT-style interface where users describe their brand in
                  their own words. But API restrictions from Meta and TikTok
                  made this technically complex. We were on a tight timeline and
                  this path would derail us.

                  it&apos;s all in one, so I can fill it out. Otherwise I
                  wouldn&apos;t know when it will end.&quot; Users felt

                the better.&quot; The AI responses were clearly AI-generated

              <p>
                But users didn&apos;t want endless filtering options. They
                wanted smart defaults that surfaced what mattered most, with the
                option to dig deeper if needed. Clarity over choice.

                After weeks working with Shadcn components, we hit a wall.
                Blueberry looked like every other B2B SaaS tool. Clean,
                functional, forgettable.
              </p>

              <p>
                The founders wanted Blueberry to feel friendly and approachable,
                not corporate. We explored references together: Duolingo&apos;s
                playfulness, Shopify&apos;s polish, Discord&apos;s casual vibe.
                We didn&apos;t want to go full cartoonish, but we also
                didn&apos;t want buttoned-up corporate.
              </p>

                What emerged: bright, inviting colors that made the interface
                feel warm. Rounded edges everywhere to soften the experience.
                And most importantly, our mascot Bloo and blueberry iconography
                threaded throughout to reinforce personality.
              </p>

              <p>
                This wasn&apos;t just aesthetic polish. Brand identity informed
                trust. A tool that feels human and approachable is easier to
                trust with your brand voice than one that feels cold and
                algorithmic.

                    weren&apos;t rejecting AI. They were being cautious, which
                    was smart. Our job was to prove ourselves.

                    We used AI tools like V0 to generate first-pass prototypes

                    70% there. The final 30% came from real people.

                    Users didn&apos;t want a black box making decisions for

                    gradually build confidence. Every design decision came back
                    to this: Can users predict what the AI will do? Can they
                    correct it? Do they feel in control?

                    The best version of Blueberry wasn&apos;t the one with the
                    most features. It was the one that removed friction and got
                    users to value fastest. Every question we removed from
                    onboarding, every filter we simplified, every preset we
                    added made the product stronger.

              </div>

              <p>
                Blueberry taught me that designing AI products isn&apos;t about
                making the technology impressive. It&apos;s about making users
                feel confident and in control.
              </p>

              <p>
                The best AI tools don&apos;t replace humans—they amplify them.
                Blueberry gave social teams superpowers: respond to everyone,
                protect their brand, capture sales opportunities, and still have
                time to focus on strategy.
              </p>

                  Users will tell you what they need if you create space to
                  listen. Every time we assumed we knew better, testing proved
                  us wrong. Every time we simplified based on feedback, the
                  product got stronger.
